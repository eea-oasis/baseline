# Zokrates component

## What is here?
<!---
Write about what is this folder and the contents. What languages, frameworks, etc...?
-->
## How does this fit in to Radish?
<!---
Explain this component in the context of the rest of the system. 
-->
## How can I run it?
<!---
Put in the normal commands to run the service and to run tests. Also mention dependencies 
-->
## What is the architecture? 
<!---
In addition to the images add some description of them explaining each part of the diagram.
I know you think your images are beautiful, self-explanatory works of technical art but please,
for the sake of us dumb sods, write a little about them.
-->
## How can this be improved?
<!---
So that others know what you're planning on doing (and how they might help) 
write about or (ideally) link to existing issues in github that are important to advance the work on the project.
If you link please use github issue filter for your component label (and if you don't have a component label, make one).
E.g. https://github.com/EYBlockchain/radish-34/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ADocumentation would show all the documentation issues that are open.
