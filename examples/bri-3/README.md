## Description

BRI-3 is a simple reference implemenation of the baseline standard, developed under [grant 85](https://github.com/eea-oasis/baseline-grants/issues/85).  


This reference implementation is being built from scratch and will contain a limited set of features. It will serve the following purposes:

 * Plug and play Baseline Reference Implementation that can cover a number of business use-cases in live environments

 * Basis for community adoption and participation of companies with real-life business cases in extending the protocol

 * Trying out the concepts from the standard in practice and producing feedback loops for standard improvements

 * Entry point for developers to get to know the protocol, and start contributing in an iterative and atomic fashion

 * Set an example of how to build an open-source project under the Baseline protocol in regard to transparency, community participation and collaboration
