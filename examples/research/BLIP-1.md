# Use of ZKP, CCSM Anchoring, and Verifiable Credentials to Create a Trustless Supply Chain. 

## Summary

This document contains research derived from the BLIP-1 and BLIP-14 efforts. These research efforts focus on determining when the use of zero knowledge proofs and anchoring state changes on a CCSM are appropriate for multi-party workflow steps. The resources listed below outline a multi-party international supply chain use case and the business & technical requirements that provide the frame for this analysis. Additionally, the requirements outlined in the documentation provided provide a foundation for which an international supply chain demo application can be implemented. 

These resources illustrate how supply chain documents (state objects) can be:
* exchanged in zero trust and under zero knowledge,
* synchronized across multiple parties,
* and verified by third parties to be correct. 

Technical elements highlighted in the following resources are:
* The use of Verifiable Credentials as state objects representing Supply Chain Documents
* The need for CCSMs to provide provable tamper resistant timestamping for new state propositions
* The use of ZKP's to provide automated validation and/or privacy
