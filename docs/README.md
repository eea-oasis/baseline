# Welcome

## Welcome to the Baseline Protocol Community

The Baseline Protocol is a framework that enables enterprises to synchronize complex, multiparty, business processes with privacy and without moving data from systems of record.&#x20;

There are many ways to learn more, get involved, get Baselined, and get value out of developing reusable components to ultimately deploying the Baseline Protocol in your own offerings. Find out more [here](./#the-baseline-protocol-reference-implementations).

The work of the community is maintained under a public domain[ license](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis/baseline/blob/master/LICENSE).

**New Contributors to the codebase and standard: Go** [**here**](community/open-source-community/contributors.md) **for contribution guidelines.**

## About the Baseline Protocol

The Baseline Protocol initiative was [announced](https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/ey-and-consensys-announce-formation-of-baseline-protocol-initiative-to-make-ethereum-mainnet-safe-and-effective-for-enterprises/) on March 4, 2020 and launched as an [OASIS](https://oasis-open-projects.org) open source project on March 19, 2020, supported by fourteen founding companies. More companies joined the effort shortly thereafter and continue to do so. In 2021, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and OASIS collaborated to establish the Baseline Protocol as an [EEA Community Projects](https://entethalliance.org/eeacommunityprojects/#:\~:text=The%20EEA%20Community%20Projects%2C%20formerly,API%20documentation%20under%20its%20stewardship.). See our list of sponsors and learn how to become a sponsor and benefits [here](https://www.baseline-protocol.org/become-a-sponsor/).

The Baseline Protocol is the emerging standard for synchronizing state across different systems of record. This applies to traditional corporate systems of record, any kind of database or [state machine](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/16447/state-machine), and even different blockchains or distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). It is particularly promising as a way to reduce capital expense and other overheads while increasing operational integrity when **automating and synchronizing business processes** across multiple companies.

The framework is designed to appeal to security and performance-minded technology officers.

## The Baseline Protocol Source Code

Version 1.0 of the Baseline Protocol has been released. It is composed of a set of 6 core packages that are available open-source, under the CC0 1.0 Universal public domain dedication. For the full license text, refer to [license](https://github.com/eea-oasis/baseline/blob/master/LICENSE).

You can find more about the source code [here](baseline-protocol-code/packages/).

## The Baseline Protocol Standard

The [Baseline Protocol Specifications ](https://github.com/eea-oasis/baseline-standard)were completed in September, 2021 and is undergoing ratification to become an [OASIS Open Standard](https://www.oasis-open.org/standards/), available under the CC0 1.0 Universal public domain dedication.

The Baseline Protocol Standard contains three specifications - [CORE](https://github.com/eea-oasis/baseline-standard/tree/main/core), API, and [CCSM](https://github.com/eea-oasis/baseline-standard/tree/main/ccsm), that provide the requirements of a compliant Baseline Protocol Implementation (BPI).

You can find more details on the Baseline Protocol Standard [here](baseline-protocol-standard/overview.md).

## The Baseline Protocol Reference Implementations

A growing number of [Reference Implementations](bri/overview-of-reference-implementations.md) and demos can be found [**here**](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis/baseline/tree/master/examples) to help you understand **baselining** and give you ideas for your implementation needs.

The first complete reference implementation, [**BRI-1**](bri/bri-1/) **** has been developed by individuals and community leaders including Provide, EY, Nethermind, ConsenSys Mesh, and others.

Today, there are demos, prototypes, and production systems being developed in more places than can be tracked, and some have been submitted as public domain contributions to the community.

### Baseledger and other Resources

The Baseline Protocol standard does not stipulate the use of any particular state machine as the common frame of reference, where baseline proofs are deposited and managed in a baselined workgroup. However, the first public Layer-2 implementation of this service is called Baseledger, details about which may be found at [https://baseledger.net](https://baseledger.net).
