# Community Leaders

Over 500 people and companies signed up to be notified about the opening of the Baseline Protocol Github repository between March 4th and 19th, 2020. Over 300 of them also signed in as group members. The members represent many of the largest companies in the world, spanning several sectors. They also represent startups, students and talented individuals.

#### People listed here or appearing on community videos or in the github repos should be assumed to be representing themselves, and not necessarily the companies they work for.\* <a href="people-listed-here-or-appearing-on-community-videos-or-in-the-github-repos-should-be-assumed-to-be-r" id="people-listed-here-or-appearing-on-community-videos-or-in-the-github-repos-should-be-assumed-to-be-r"></a>

> \*(In the mid-1990s, the [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java\_\(programming\_language\)) community amassed thousands of developers from many companies before any of those companies officially sanctioned their involvement. Many of the companies participating in the Baseline Protocol initiative embrace the work, some already adding baselining to their strategic plans. But anyone observing someone's participation in the baseline community should assume that they do so as individuals. Please refrain from making assertions about the intentions of their employers.)

### Project Governance Board <a href="your-project-governance-board" id="your-project-governance-board"></a>

The project governance board (PGB) is organized by OASIS and is accountable for ensuring the balance and integrity of the Ethereum-Oasis initiatives, such as the Baseline Protocol.

### Community Organizers <a href="your-technical-steering-committee" id="your-technical-steering-committee"></a>

OASIS employs key personnel that support all the open standards and open source projects under its domain. In addition, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance maintains a team that also supports EEA Community Projects such as the Baseline Protocol. And finally, members such as ConsenSys have assigned key personnel specifically to support and organize the community.

### Technical Steering Committee 2021/22 <a href="your-technical-steering-committee" id="your-technical-steering-committee"></a>

The technical steering committee (TSC) is accountable to the Project Governance Board for managing conflicts on merges and Core Dev self-organization. It also governs the allocation of grant money. And it meets regularly to set technical roadmaps and ensure progress of the community toward the ubiquitous implementation of the baseline protocol in systems of record everywhere.

On October 27, 2021, the following people were voted in as the TSC through October 2022 and the date of the next election's results.

## Standards Team

The standards team worked through most of 2021 to develop a world-class technical specification that implementers and test developers can use to ensure compliance with the baseline protocol specification. The draft will now be shepherded through the OASIS process of review and amendments, culminating in becoming an official OASIS standard. Standards writing is hard, and reviewing the writing is equally hard. This team deserves the highest regard from the community for its hard-toiling service and commitment to excellence.
