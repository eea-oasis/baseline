# Open Source Community

The number of active companies and individuals contributing to the work and using it in products and enterprise solutions is rapidly growing.&#x20;

Our open source team members are the drivers of the development and adoption of the Baseline Protocol. The work is active and always open to new contributors.&#x20;

### **Resources**

* ****[**Get Involved**](https://www.baseline-protocol.org/get-involved/)**-** sign up and get involved in our open source teams&#x20;
* [**Community Member Starter Kit**](https://www.baseline-protocol.org/resources/)**-** understand how you can contribute as a community member and how the open source community operates
* [**Slack**](https://join.slack.com/t/ethereum-baseline/shared\_invite/zt-d6emqeci-bjzBsXBqK4D7tBTZ40AEfQ)**-** join our community Slack and say hello

## **Teams**

> ### Baseline Core Devs
>
> Core Devs are the backbone of the Baseline open source community and have an active role in advancing the Baseline Protocol and/or related projects. Join the next generation of developers leading the rise of ubiquitous sync services to state machines everywhere.
>
> ### Outreach Team
>
> Outreach members communicate, advocate, and educate the world on the advantages of using and contributing to the protocol. Several working groups create enablement materials, devise industry-specific use cases, and document the significant work being done in the community.
>
> ### Standards Team
>
> Members of the standards team work to define and contribute to the specifications of baseline compliance. The [Standards](broken-reference) is currently in the ratification process to become an official [Oasis Standard](https://www.oasis-open.org).

## **Leadership** <a href="#leadership" id="leadership"></a>

In an openly governed, open source project, leadership is organic. Anyone interested in following the governance and leading efforts across the various teams and focuses, can become a prominent leader in the community.&#x20;

> The way to lead is to start something, help something, fix something...even spellcheck something! The way to lead is to get others to amplify what you are doing (best done by listening deeply to others first). The way to lead is to serve your own (and your company's) enlightened self interest. You should be able to directly    draw a straight line from your time on this work to real impact for the adoption of this standard.

**Information on our groups of elected and voluntary community leaders can be** [**found here**](../community-leaders/)**.**

## Working Together <a href="#working-together" id="working-together"></a>

Anyone can join the Baseline Protocol communication channels (see below), and anyone with a Github ID can view the [roadmap](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/baseline-5e713dc4f555144d9d6d17f6/roadmap) (don't forget to log in with github id), fork the [repo](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis), and submit pull requests to contribute to the work.

You can also become a regular [**Member**](members.md) of the initiative, which will allow you to manage Issues and push directly to most repo branches (other than Master). Members who step up to be accountable for projects can become [**General Assembly**](../community-leaders/specifications-steering-committee.md) members. Members who take on responsibility for maintaining the integrity of the work and merging contributions to the master branch of the repo can become [**Core Developers**](../community-leaders/maintainers.md). And finally, contributors can nominate and vote-in members to be on the governing [**Technical Steering Committee**](../../governance/technical-steering-committee.md) (TSC) annually.

Below are the things to know about how to get involved and work with the team.

### Meetings and Meetups <a href="#meetings-and-meetups" id="meetings-and-meetups"></a>

There are regular meetings of the TSC, General Assembly, Core Developers and other groups. These are typically listed [**here**](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/baseline/calendar). If the times we have don't work for your timezone, we can do 1-1's or make changes to the schedule.

#### Onboarding: Help Getting Started <a href="#onboarding-help-getting-started" id="onboarding-help-getting-started"></a>

It's critical that new contributors have a good idea about what the focal points of the community are and where one can make a real impact. It's hard to beat having a real conversation about how to get started in an intimate setting where you can ask questions and get immediate answers.

We will hold Onboarding office hours once a week. Watch the [**Calendar**](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/baseline/calendar) for details or inquire on one of the [communication channels](./#communications-connecting-with-each-other-directly) below. Sessions and other learning material will be posted on our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxmhMSa49Q1CVwTdcUNeoqoME6GRwtSTA) and on [Medium](https://medium.com/baselineprotocol).

#### Technical Steering Committee <a href="#technical-steering-committee" id="technical-steering-committee"></a>

The [TSC](../community-leaders/#your-technical-steering-committee) meets typically once a month to review progress. Members of the TSC receive invitations and you can rsvp to join any meeting by sending a message to the [TSC Chair](../community-leaders/#your-provisional-chair).

#### General Assembly <a href="#specifications-steering-committee" id="specifications-steering-committee"></a>

The [General Assembly](../community-leaders/specifications-steering-committee.md) meets typically once a month to review roadmaps and set high-level priorities. Members of the General Assembly receive invitations, and you can join any meeting by sending a message to the [TSC Chair](../community-leaders/#your-provisional-chair).

### Communications: Connecting with Each Other Directly <a href="#communications-connecting-with-each-other-directly" id="communications-connecting-with-each-other-directly"></a>

#### Slack / Discord / Telegram <a href="#slack-discourse-telegram" id="slack-discourse-telegram"></a>

The Baseline Protocol initiative maintains a Slack channel that is moderated but public. Sign up [**here**](https://communityinviter.com/apps/ethereum-baseline/join-us). It's an active group, and you can directly connect with folks doing the work and coordinate with each other to get the work done.

Thanks to an enterprising member of the community, we now also have a shared Matterbridge-enabled channel between [**Slack**](https://communityinviter.com/apps/ethereum-baseline/join-us), [**Telegram**](https://t.me/baselineprotocol), and [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/NE8AYD7). You can post -- and read what anyone posts -- on the shared channel, regardless of which platform you are using. In Slack, use the #community-chat channel to broadcast to Slack, Discord and Telegram. In Discord, use the #general channel. In Telegram, just use the main /baselineprotocol thread.

#### Members Directory <a href="#members-directory" id="members-directory"></a>

You can [**sign up**](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/baseline) to the baseline protocol members list and get access to the [**Directory**](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/baseline/directory). This will show you any members who have elected to be displayed publicly. There are others who will choose to be hidden but will receive group emails.

#### Group Email <a href="#group-email" id="group-email"></a>

While most communication seems to go through the Slack/Discord/Telegram channel, we do have email. When you [**sign up**](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/baseline) in the members directory, you will have the option to get email that's sent to the mailing list or directly from anyone in the group. You can control how that impacts your inbox [**here**](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/baseline/editsub).

#### Forums <a href="#forums" id="forums"></a>

The Baseline Protocol initiative is launching soon a [**Discourse forum**](https://discourse.baseline-protocol.org). Reddit is also likely. We also actively use commenting on Epics and Issues to conduct threaded discussions on key projects and engineering topics. To View the [**Zenhub Board**](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/baseline-5e713dc4f555144d9d6d17f6/board?repos=239590893) for these, sign into Github with your ID, or you can install the Zenhub plugin to your Chrome browser and sign in that way. If you are member of the Ethereum-Oasis Org.

The Baseline Protocol initiative maintains the [**@baselineproto**](https://twitter.com/baselineproto) Twitter account, to which members of the TSC, General Assembly and some maintainers can post. We also use the [**#baselineprotocol**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Baselineprotocol) tag.

#### Medium <a href="#medium" id="medium"></a>

The Baseline Protocol initiative uses Medium to post blogs. Here is the [**publication**](https://medium.com/baselineprotocol). Reach out on Slack to the [TSC Chair](../community-leaders/#your-provisional-chair), OASIS team or members of the steering committees, if you want to be a writer or editor.

#### YouTube <a href="#youtube" id="youtube"></a>

The Baseline Protocol initiative maintains a [**YouTube Channel**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxmhMSa49Q1CVwTdcUNeoqoME6GRwtSTA). If you have videos that you'd like to add to the Channel or would like to help on Baseline Protocol video assets, use the Slack [#comms-and-marketing](https://ethereum-baseline.slack.com/archives/C011NCZ2ES1) channel and raise your hand.
