# How to become a maintainer?

To become a maintainer you need to show consistent contributions of code or ideas to the project. This can be in the form of pull requests that get merged into master. Or it can be in the form of issues/planning artifacts that guide the development activities of others. A maintainer needs to be an expert in one or more fields related to the project, show commitment, be reliable, and demonstrate competency.

At the weekly Maintainer Meetings the current members can propose who should be added as a new maintainer and why. The current maintainers must vote with over 2/3rds majority in favor.

# How maintainers organize?

## Slack 
Maintainers meet and discuss issues virtually via the private #maintainers slack room in the [baseline slack](ethereum-baseline.slack.com). 

## Weekly Meetings (online)
There are weekly *Maintainers meetings* where members can discuss plans and issues related to the project, updates, release planning, etc... 

# How to stop being a maintainer?

If you are a maintainer you can be voted out if any of the following occur: 

 - You stop reviewing PR's, responding to messages, answering emails, and/or generally ghost the project.
 - You are disrespectful towards anyone in the community and/or involved in the project in some way.
 - You violate [the code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
